        <h1>Halloween Adventure &mdash; How to Play</h1>

        <h2>Rolling Dice</h2>

        <p>
            When you want to perform an action that isn't guaranteed to succeed, you roll one or more dice to determine the outcome. Most often, you roll two dice: One representing a <em>Character Trait</em>, which is the character's innate ability, and one representing their <em>Skill Level</em>, which is how much expertise they have in the particular action. Unless otherwise specified (e.g. with <em>bonus damage</em>), you roll the dice and take the highest result. If that meets or exceeds your target value, you succeed on the attempt.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Automatic Failure:</strong> If all of your dice roll 1, you automatically fail an attempt. (Note that things like damage and <em>HP</em> recovery are not attempts and therefore cannot fail. They may be canceled by other effects, though, such as a character being immune to the damage.)
        </p>

        <h3>Character Traits</h3>
        <p>
            Character traits in this game are represented by the size of the die rolled for them. For example, your best trait is listed as <em>d12</em>, and you roll a 12-sided die when using that trait.
        </p>

        <p>
            During character creation, assign a <em>d4</em>, <em>d6</em>, <em>d8</em>, <em>d10</em>, and a <em>d12</em> to the following traits:
        </p>
        
        <h4>Traits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Murder</strong>: Physical combat and brute strength actions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mayhem</strong>: Intense, rapid, and chaotic actions (except Choas Magic).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Guts</strong>: Fortitude, gut feelings, and recovery in battle. Most importantly, you roll Guts (typically without any Skill) to recover <em>HP</em> at the start of your turn, and, when wounded, you roll Guts to survive your wounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Braaains</strong>: Thinking about things and stuff (and being tasty to zombies). Also, psychic powers (if you have any).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spookiness</strong>: Dark magic, supernatural powers, stealth, being generally terrifying.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Skill</h3>

        <p>
            Your level of skill for attempting something is split into three tiers: Archetypes, Specializations, and Signatures. Archetypes are broader sets of skills that offer a limited bonus, Specializations offer a more focused subset of skills and a slightly greater bonus, and Signatures are specific things your character can do with the greatest chance of success and special effects such as extra damage or setting your opponents on fire. If you are attempting something that is not included in one of your Archetypes, Specializations, or Signatures, you roll a <em>d6</em> for your Skill die.
        </p>

        <p>
            When creating your character, you choose 3 Archetypes. Under those Archetypes, you choose 3 Specializations, and under those Specializations, you in turn choose 3 Signatures.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Archetypes
        </h4>

        <p>
            Archetypes are broad character classifications that your character can apply. These include things like innate biological abilities, professions and trades, and character classes. For anything that falls under one of your character Archetypes but not a Specialization or Signature, you roll a <strong>d8</strong> for your Skill die.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Specializations
        </h4>

        <p>
            Specializations are skills your character has focused on developing. These are things like <em>fire magic</em> and <em>two-handed weapons</em>. When attempting something that fits one of your Specializations, you roll a <strong>d10</strong> for your Skill die.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Signatures
        </h4>

        <p>
            Signatures are specific abilities your character can do, such as hitting an opponent so hard with a hammer that it creates a shockwave that deals damage in an area. The effects of these Signature abilities are specifically listed in their description, and you roll a <strong>d12</strong> for your Skill die when using a Signature.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Combat</h2>

        <h3>Taking Your Turn</h3>

        <p>
            On your turn, you can move up to your <em>speed</em> and take upto 2 <em>actions</em>. You may also be allowed to do various other, bonus actions determined by your Signatures or actions simple enough that your GM allows them (like drawing a weapon, opening a door, or picking up a single item), and you have a single Reaction you can use once per round. You get your reaction back at the start of your turn.
        </p>

        <h3>Health and Wounds</h3>

        <p>
            In this game, <em>HP</em> is an overall resilience and combat effectiveness. Your character is not actually hurt until their <em>HP</em> reaches 0 and you receive a <em>wound</em>, and you recover some <em>HP</em> each turn as you overcome lesser attacks.
        </p>
            
        <blockquote>
            <em>HP</em> in this game is less a measure of physical damage (injuries and wounds) done in battle and more a measure of wearing through the character's defenses before doing the actual damage. You could think of it as a measure of combat prowess and how much they can take a hit without it doing serious damage. As such, it is still appropriate to call them "hit points," but still a little different in how we're used to imagining combat playing out.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Recovery</h4>

        <p>
            Some <em>HP</em> is recovered ever turn. Because <em>HP</em> doesn't directly measure damage, a character regains some of the endurance and resilience that makes up their <em>HP</em> each turn. At the beginning of your turn, roll Guts (with no Skill die) and recover that much HP.
        </p>

        <h4>Wounds</h4>

        <p>
            When you reach <em>0 HP</em>, you are <em>wounded</em>. Increase your <em>wounds</em> by 1, then roll <em>Guts</em>. If you roll below your total number of <em>wounds</em>, you are <em>unconscious</em>. If the entire party falls unconscious, your party loses.
        </p>

        <h3>Actions</h3>

        <h4>Attack</h4>

        <p>
            Roll one Trait die (typically Murder unless otherwise specified) and one Skill die (<em>d8</em> if utilizing one of your Archetypes, <em>d10</em> if utilizing a Specialization, <em>d12</em> if using one of your Signatures, or <em>d6</em> if none of these). Whichever die is higher is your attack result. If this value is greater than or equal to the target's Defense, the attack hits and deals damage.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Damage:</strong> To determine your damage, roll your Trait die and the damage die of your weapon (or the damage die described in the Signature). Whichever die is higher determines the base damage done by your attack before modifiers like resistances or vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Critical Hits &ndash; Lucky Number 7:</strong> Whenever one or more of your Attack dice roll a 7, you double the damage done by the attack if it hits.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
            <strong>Missing Attacks:</strong> You still influence combat even if you miss. (Reroll lower die?)
        </p> -->

        <p>
            <strong>Critical Miss:</strong> If all of your dice roll 1, you automatically miss.
        </p>

        <h4>Cast Spell</h4>

        <p>
            As an action, choose up to two spell properties. If you have at least an Archetype that allows you to use magic, you cast the spell successfully (although the effects, especially an attack, will still require a roll). Otherwise, you can attempt to cast a spell by rolling Spookiness. The difficulty is 5 for casting a spell with one properties or 7 for two properties.
        </p>

        <p>
            For more information, see the section below on Magic.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Dash</h4>
        
        <p>
            You move up to your movement speed as an action.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Defend</h4>
        
        <p>
            Each time you are attacked before the start of your next turn, you roll <em>Mayhem</em>, and if the result is higher than your defense, you use the result for your defense against that attack instead.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you have a shield, you can roll <em>Murder</em> instead.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Drag</h4>
        
        <p>
            Make a contested <em>Murder</em> roll against a target you have grappled. If you win, you can move yourself and the target up to your speed.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Grapple</h4>
        
        <p>
            Make an attack against the target. If it hits, the target is grappled. They may try to escape as an action with contested <em>Murder</em> rolls. As an action while you have the target grappled, you can attempt to drag, throw, or slam the target.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Hide</h4>
        
        <p>
            You roll <em>Spookiness</em>. You are hidden to creatures you are obscured from unless they use an action to roll <em>Braaains</em> to contest your <em>Spookiness</em> roll result.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Push</h4>
        
        <p>
            Make a contested <em>Murder</em> roll against the target. If you at least roll at or above their defense, you push the target up to 10 ft. away from you. If you also exceed their roll, the target is knocked down. If the target hits an object or fails the contested roll, they are also dealt d4 bludgeoning damage.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Slam</h4>
        
        <p>
            Make a contested <em>Murder</em> roll against the target. If you at least roll at or above their defense, you knock the target down. If you also exceed their roll, you deal d6 bludgeoning damage.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Throw</h4>
        
        <p>
            Make a contested <em>Murder</em> roll against the target. If you at least roll at or above their defense, you throw the target up to 15 ft. from your location. If you also exceed their roll, the target is knocked down. If the target hits an object or fails the contested roll, they are also dealt d6 bludgeoning damage. 
        </p>

        <h3>Reactions</h3>

        <h4>Finishing Strike</h4>

        <p>
            When a creature is hit by an attack but not wounded, you may use your quick action to attempt to deal a severe blow against the creature. You make a non-signature attack against the creature. If the creature has more than half of its max <em>HP</em> remaining, the attack automatically misses, and the creature gets a free quick action if it uses it immediately afterward. If the creature has half or fewer of its max <em>HP</em> remaining, however, then any hit automatically reduces the target to 0 <em>HP</em>.
        </p>

        <!--Help?-->

        <h4>Intercept</h4>
        <p>
            When a creature attempts to move through a space adjacent to you, you can try to block that movement. You roll your <em>Murder</em> against your opponent's <em>Murder</em>, preventing them from moving for the remainder of the turn if you best them.
        </p>


        <h4>Quick Step</h4>
        <p>
            When a creature moves to a space adjacent to you or when a creature in an adjacent square uses the <em>quick step</em> reaction, you may move 5 ft. as a reaction.
        </p>

        <h4>Quick Defense</h4>
        <p>
            When a creature would hit you with an attack, you may use your reaction to defend against that attack.
        </p>

        <h4>Recover</h4>
        <p>
            When you fail a roll for an action, you may use your reaction to reroll the lower die. If the action was a Signature action, you must also use a regular action in place of the Signature.
        </p>

        <h4>Take Cover</h4>
        <p>
            When a creature targets you with a ranged attack or area effect, you may use your reaction to drop prone and move up to 5 ft. in any direction.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Magic</h2>

        <p>
            You may cast a single spell on each of your turns using an action. The spell uses one of the spell effects below, and can be cast out to 25 ft. and, if no other damage option is chosen, it deals d6 dark damage.
        </p>

        <h3>Chaos Magic</h3>

        <p>
            Pick two spell effects. Roll to cast the spell composed of those two effects. If you roll doubles, the spell produces a chaotic backlash. If you roll double ones, the spell also fails, but otherwise you still cast the spell.
        </p>

        <h3>Rune Magic</h3>

        <p>
            As an action, you inscribe a rune, adding a spell effect to a runic spell, and, if you have not cast a spell already this turn, you may cast your runic spell. Each turn, you can use this action build upon the same runes, replace a rune, or start another spell. You can have up to five runes for a spell, and up to three spells at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Spell Effects
        </h3>

            </li>
            <li>
                The spell effects an area with a 15 ft. radius.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase the range of the spell by 25 ft.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the speed of the target by half until they are healed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the target's recovery by half until they are healed.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Create an illusion for 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                You become invisible until the end of your next turn.
            </li>

                Heal the target.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extend the duration of an effect that lasts until the end of your or the target's next turn. At the end of the turn when the spell would end, roll Spookiness. If you roll at least 5, the effect continues, and the difficulty to extend the duration increases by 1 for the next turn. The effect also ends if you fall unconscious or choose to end it, requiring no action. You may have 1 such extended effect at a time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Raise stone 20 ft. in the area of the spell or a 5 ft. diameter pillar.
